# Research Findings: HIS Subsystem Implementation

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection

Based on the project requirements and constraints, the following technology stack has been selected:

**Backend**: Python 3.8+ + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Oracle SQL Server
- **Rationale**: FastAPI provides excellent performance, automatic API documentation, and type safety. SQLAlchemy ORM offers flexibility in database operations. Oracle SQL Server is required for enterprise healthcare environments.
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - Django vs FastAPI: FastAPI chosen for better performance and modern async support
  - PostgreSQL vs Oracle: Oracle required per project specifications

**Frontend**: Tabler Admin Template + ES6 Components + Bootstrap 5
- **Rationale**: Tabler provides a complete admin interface with healthcare-appropriate UI components. ES6 modules offer zero dependencies and full control for offline environments. Bootstrap 5 provides responsive design.
- **Alternatives considered**: 
  - React vs Vanilla JS: Vanilla JS chosen to avoid dependency overhead and ensure complete offline functionality
  - Other admin templates: Tabler chosen for healthcare UI appropriateness

**Deployment**: Nginx + Uvicorn
- **Rationale**: Nginx provides efficient static file serving and reverse proxy capabilities. Uvicorn offers high-performance ASGI server for FastAPI.

## Decision: Authentication Method

**Selected**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Rationale**: Statelessness is important for scalability, and JWT provides secure token-based authentication suitable for API-based architecture
- **Security considerations**: Implementation includes bcrypt password hashing, secure token storage, and refresh token rotation

## Decision: Database Schema Design

**Selected**: Normalized design with TREEMP, TREDEP, TREUSER tables
- **Rationale**: Follows existing hospital system conventions while providing necessary relationships between employees, departments, and authentication
- **Considerations**: Indexing strategy designed for common query patterns in healthcare environments

## Decision: Component Architecture

**Selected**: ES6-based component system with dynamic loading
- **Rationale**: Modular approach enables maintainability and follows architectural principle of modularity while supporting offline deployment
- **Alternative**: Traditional templating systems were considered but ES6 modules provide better maintainability

## Decision: Security Implementation

**Selected**: Multi-layered security approach
- **Rationale**: Implements security at all levels (transport, storage, application) as required by healthcare regulations
- **Components**: HTTPS enforcement, SQL injection prevention, XSS/CSRF protection, secure password storage
