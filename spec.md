# Feature Specification: HIS Subsystem Technical Specifications

**Feature Branch**: `001-his-subsystem-technical-specifications`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "HIS subsystem with employee/department management, authentication, and web interface"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Employee Login and Dashboard Access (Priority: P1)

Medical staff member accesses the system using employee ID and password to view the dashboard with quick stats and navigation to other modules.

**Why this priority**: Critical for any usage of the system; login is the gateway to all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering valid employee credentials and verifying access to the dashboard with correct user information displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the login page, **When** valid employee ID and password are entered and login button is clicked, **Then** user is redirected to the dashboard with appropriate greeting and user information.
2. **Given** user enters invalid credentials, **When** login button is clicked, **Then** an error message is displayed and user remains on the login page.

### User Story 2 - Employee Management (Priority: P1)

HR personnel can view a list of employees, search and filter them, and create new employees or update existing ones.

**Why this priority**: Central feature of the system essential for managing staff in a hospital setting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by performing CRUD operations on employee records and verifying the changes are persisted and displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is authenticated and on the employee list page, **When** user searches for an employee by name or ID, **Then** filtered results are displayed.
2. **Given** user is on employee creation page, **When** valid employee details are entered and saved, **Then** new employee appears in the system with correct information.
3. **Given** user wants to update an employee record, **When** employee details are modified and saved, **Then** changes are reflected in the system.

### User Story 3 - Department Management (Priority: P2)

Administrators can view department structures, create new departments, update existing ones, and assign employees to departments.

**Why this priority**: Important for organizing staff but can be partially functional while employee management is the focus.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating, updating, and viewing departments and verifying the relationships with employees.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the department management page, **When** user creates a new department, **Then** the department is added to the system with correct information.
2. **Given** user wants to assign an employee to a department, **When** employee is selected and department is assigned, **Then** the employee appears in the correct department listing.
